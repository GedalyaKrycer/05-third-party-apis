Work Day Scheduler 

## Goals 
* Using the moment.js API, display the current date in the header.

* Using HTML and provided CSS styles, build a form that accepts user notes for each hour of the working day. (9am - 5pm) 

* Capture user's inputs in Local Storage so that on refresh, the text stays in the textArea input field. 

* Using the moment.js API, highlight for the user where in the day they are.  
    * Grey: Past hours 
    * Green: Future hours 
    * Red: Present hour


## Results to date
* Current date is showing up in the header via the moment.js API

* Form is showing up on the html page, however it is hard coded and not dynamically generated via JS/jQuery. 

* Local storage is not capturing inputs correctly and is not returning them. (Code has not been set up for the latter.)

* Background highlighting is not responding to the API and all are keeping their default "grey".
